Our team was tasked to determine where helicopters and their crews should be based around the upstate New York region to best respond to emergency calls. We conducted a discrete event simulation analysis in Python, using a historical dataset from the existing operation to make this determination. We found that the optimal locations for helicopters in the upstate area were in Albany, Rochester, Syracuse, Buffalo, and Binghamton, and Watertown, with 11 helicopters spread across those cities.
